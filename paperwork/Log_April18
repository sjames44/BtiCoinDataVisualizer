This week our primary focus was parsing our dataset and implementing the primary objects and method for our graph. We decided on parsing the CSV file with a fstream object and storing our data into a adjacency matrix. We implemented a struct for both a vertex and an edge with respective private data members and documented helper methods to assist data parsing process. Additionally we had our mdipoint meeting on the project on Friday, we are considering on changing primary struction of a two by two matrix to something that is more efficient as given by the instructor. Our goal for this week is to work on the make file, resolve merge conflict and write test cases for all our method implementations.
