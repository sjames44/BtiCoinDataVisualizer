# CS 225 Staff Final Project
## Team Members: Dawid Pachura, Steven James, Anton Sebastian

###Important info:
 - For the most part all of our main code resides in Graph.cpp/Graph.h. These two files contain the Graph class, which contains a struct Vertex, a vector
 - of vertices, and an adjacency matrix. The Vertex struct holds an id and an average rating. A file reader, Dijkstra's Algorithm, a breadth first traversal,
 - and our visualization algorithm. 
 
 
 ###Test cases:
 - Our test cases can be found under the tests folder in tests.cpp, where test1.txt, test2.txt, and realtest.txt are inputs and realtestout.txt
 - is an output. 


###Commands:
make - compiles all necessary files for the program to run
make test - compiles all test cases and other files
./finalproj -
./test - runs all test cases
