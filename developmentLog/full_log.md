**Week of 04/04/2021:**
This week, we met multiple times to work on our final project proposal as well as the team contract. 
We hashed out what we wanted to do for the project, as well as what algorithms we wanted to implement. 
In the end, we chose a dataset that keeps track of the “trust level” of bitcoin traders. We want to create a 
visual representation of our graph as well as possibly implementing the page rank algorithm to find the best user for the graph.

**Week of 04/11/2021:**
04/14/2021 - We discussed what we were going to accomplish for the rest of the week, mainly the next day. Decided we would 
implement a way for reading the CSV file into our git repository. We were planning on beginning the skeleton of our data structure, 
but after some discussion with our advisor we are leaning more towards a directed graph, which is the way our data is provided.

04/15/2021 - Decided to hold off until lecture to implement the graph.

**Week of 04/18/2021:**
04/18/2021 - Began implementation of graph. Decided what functions to implement and the specifics behind the graph, including the 
vertex and edge structures. Also began working on our File Reader object, which is what we are going to use to read the data 
from the dataset into our structure. We will most likely implement the basics of our structure before completing the
file reader.
